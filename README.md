# python for biologists - notes
this repository contains my personal notes from studying python for biologists by Martin Jones. The notes summarize my understanding of the book and practical coding exercises. 

i modified or expanded the exercises to test my understanding and to push myself.

these notes are meant to:
- help me review my notes and track my progress.
- serve as a resource for others learning python for biological data analysis.

The notes cover the following topics:

    ✅ text manipulation
    ✅ reading files
    ✅ lists & loops
    ✅ functions
    ✅ conditional tests
    ✅ regular expressions & exercises
    ✅ dictionaries
    ✅ files, programs, and user input
    ✅ handling BLAST and protein sequences
    ✅ troubleshooting common issues in WSL & Python libraries
