# python for biologists - notes
this repository contains my personal notes from studying _python for biologists_ by Martin Jones. The notes summarize my understanding of the book and practical coding exercises. 

i modified or expanded the exercises to test my understanding and to push myself.

these notes are meant to:
- help me review my notes and track my progress.
- serve as a resource for others learning python for biological data analysis.

the notes cover the following topics:

    ✅ text manipulation
    ✅ reading files
    ✅ lists & loops
    ✅ functions
    ✅ conditional tests
    ✅ regular expressions & exercises
    ✅ dictionaries
    ✅ files, programs, and user input
    ✅ handling BLAST and protein sequences
    ✅ troubleshooting common issues in WSL & Python libraries


# tools i use in this repository  

i use WSL as my operating system, and my code editor is VS Code.  
you can access wsl remotely inside vs code. this setup has worked perfectly for me, but you can use the tools you feel most comfortable with.
